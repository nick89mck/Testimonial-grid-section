## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

Mainly used this project to refamiliarize myself with CSS grid and Flexbox. Also learned clip-path ellipse for the creation of the quotation sudo element.

### Continued development

There's probably a better way of having the grid items span multiple rows/ columns rather than hard assigning them. Using a utility class to assign them perhaps.
